# RGB LED Control V1.0
The RGB LED Control project aims to demonstrate the capabilities of the Tiva C TM4C123GXL LaunchPad board by implementing 
a simple user interface using the SW1 button. The project enables users to control the color and behavior of an RGB LED 
by pressing the SW1 button on the board. By combining the power of the Tiva C microcontroller and the versatility of the 
RGB LED, this project offers an interactive and visually engaging experience.
