# RGB LED Control V2.0
The RGB LED Control project aims to demonstrate the capabilities of the Tiva C TM4C123GXL LaunchPad board by implementing 
a simple user interface using the SW1 button. The project enables users to control the color and behavior of an RGB LED by 
pressing the SW1 button on the board. Additionally, a one-second delay functionality is incorporated, ensuring that if the 
switch is pressed, the LED turns off after a brief pause. By combining the power of the Tiva C microcontroller, 
the versatility of the RGB LED, and the added delay feature, this project offers an interactive and visually engaging
experience.
